Inspired by [Native-Land.ca](https://native-land.ca/), our mission is to promote, preserve, and protect Indigenous languages, histories, and cultures. Rooted provides materials and resources to aid people looking to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples on whose land they are on, and language-learning resources for those who want to add to the local community of Indigenous language speakers.
