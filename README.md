Inspired by [Native-Land.ca](https://native-land.ca/), our mission is to promote, preserve, and protect Indigenous languages, histories, and cultures. Rooted provides materials and resources to aid people looking to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples on whose land they are on, and language-learning resources for those who want to add to the local community of Indigenous language speakers.

### Overview
rooted is a progressive web app featuring a global map in which users can toggle territories, languages, and settler lines in order to learn about the Indigenous presence around their location. By clicking on a colored polygon users can view the names of the corresponding language as well as sample land acknowledgement statements that can be used as a starting point for further research and exploration. Some languages feature links in their popups to external resources as well as language-learning components. The language-learning consists of a vocab table with basic phrases and a scrolling memorization flashcard game.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Firestore, Firebase, React, React-Bootstrap, Bootstrap, Material-UI, deck.gl, Mapbox GL JS, Anime.js, Animate On Scroll, Material Design, Sass, Chatwoot

### Upcoming Features: 

* Land acknowledgment prompts based on territory
* Currently, we have over 200 clickable language map features and are constantly expanding interactivity
* User to user interaction through chat and a community calendar
* Additional data visualization
* Expanded learning support for more Indigenous languages
* Audio for language learning (currently we have Dakota and Mohegan)
